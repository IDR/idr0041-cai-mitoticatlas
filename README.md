### Description

Using the cell and nuclear boundaries as landmarks, we generated a 4D image data-driven, canonical model of a human mitotic cell. This model is used to integrate the dynamic distribution of 3D concentration data for many mitotic proteins imaged by calibrated fluorescence microscopy in a large number of dividing cells. Analysis of the data allows to automatically identify sub-cellular structures and quantify the timing and magnitude of protein fluxes between structures, as well as predicting dynamic multi-molecular biological processes such as organelle assembly and disassembly. The integrated experimental and computational method enables building a 4D protein atlas of the dividing human cell.
